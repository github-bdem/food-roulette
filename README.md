## History

About 5 years ago I put together a fun little side project called [Goto.Pizza](https://github.com/github-bdem/goto.pizza)

![goto.pizza interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bdell/goto.pizza/master/public/screenshot.png)

However due to life and work getting in the way, the site eventually became outdated. Once I found out that my beloved side project was no longer working I decided to not just re-do the project but instead update it and add more functionality so that you aren't just stuck with looking for one type of food only.

## Built Using

This project was created using:

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI v5](https://daisyui.com/)
- [React Google Maps](https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/)
- [New Google Maps Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/nearby-search)

## Technical Features

This project has been extended from the original basic vite project and now has the following features:

- Eslint config expanded with vite recommended production options
- Pinned node version to ensure compatibility with dependencies
- Path aliases setup for easy importing of components and assets
- Minimum prettier configured
- Custom DaisyUI theme
- Configured Tailwind CSS name ordering
- Tailwind CSS name autocompletion in vscode

## Running

To run this project please refer to the [Vite rundocs](https://vite.dev/guide/)
